# Shopee-sentiment-analysis-by-RoBERTa-and-ABSA-model

This repository contains the code for a sentiment analysis system that analyzes customer feedback to improve customer satisfaction. The system leverages advanced techniques RoBERTa for sentiment analysis and Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) to identify specific aspects mentioned in customer comments.

## Getting Started
Please follow the instruction mentioned in Colab files.

## Features

- Sentiment analysis of customer feedback.
- Aspect extraction to identify areas of concern.

## Future Enhancements

- Develop a user-friendly GUI for better accessibility.
- Optimize system efficiency to reduce processing time.
- Incorporate more human interaction points for improved user experience.

## Acknowledgements

- The RoBERTa model.
- The Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) technique.
